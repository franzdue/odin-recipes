    <h2>What is Pasta</h2>
    <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. <strong>Rice flour</strong>, or <strong>legumes</strong> such as <em>beans</em> or <em>lentils</em>, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a <strong>gluten-free</strong> alternative. Pasta is a <strong>staple food</strong> of <strong>Italian cuisine</strong>.</p>
